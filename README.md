## ✨ Overview

Welcome to Your Project Name! We are dedicated to making advanced language models accessible and fun for young users by bringing high-performance, in-browser LLM inference directly to their devices.

Our core focus is the implementation of a **specially fine-tuned LLaMA model optimized for kid-friendly language and content**. This allows for engaging, age-appropriate, and interactive AI experiences that run entirely within the web browser, accelerated by WebGPU, and without the need for external servers.

This approach ensures privacy and enables offline functionality, opening up exciting possibilities for educational tools, interactive stories, and creative applications for children. Use Your Project Name as a base for your own web applications that leverage this on-device AI capability.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Jumpstart your development with Your Project Name! Here's how to integrate our engine, powered by the fine-tuned LLaMA model for kids:

### Installation

Install the package using your preferred package manager:

```sh
# npm
npm install @your-scope/your-package-name
# yarn
yarn add @your-scope/your-package-name
# or pnpm
pnpm install @your-scope/your-package-name


Import the necessary modules:

// Import everything
import * as yourProject from "@your-scope/your-package-name";
// Or only import what you need
import { CreateYourEngine } from "@your-scope/your-package-name";

Create Your Engine

Initialize the engine with the kid-friendly LLaMA model:

import { CreateYourEngine } from "@your-scope/your-package-name";

// Optional callback for tracking loading progress
const initProgressCallback = (initProgress) => {
  console.log("Loading progress:", initProgress);
}

// Specify our fine-tuned kid's language model
const selectedModel = "KidFriendly-LLaMA-7B-Instruct-q4f16_1-YOURPROJECT"; // Use your own model identifier

const engine = await CreateYourEngine(
  selectedModel,
  { initProgressCallback: initProgressCallback }, // Engine configuration options
);

console.log("Your Project Name engine initialized successfully!");

You can also create and load the engine separately:

import { YourEngineClass } from "@your-scope/your-package-name"; // Use your actual class name

// Synchronous call
const engine = new YourEngineClass({
  initProgressCallback: initProgressCallback
});

// Asynchronous call to load the model
await engine.reload(selectedModel);

Chat Completion

Engage the fine-tuned model to generate responses:

const messages = [
  { role: "system", content: "You are a friendly and imaginative AI for kids." },
  { role: "user", content: "Can you tell me a silly story about a talking cat?" },
]

const reply = await engine.chat.completions.create({
  messages,
  // Add any other parameters like temperature, max_tokens, etc.
});
console.log("AI Response:", reply.choices[0].message.content);
console.log("Usage Info:", reply.usage); // If your engine provides usage info

Streaming Responses

For interactive applications like chatbots for kids, streaming is essential:

const messages = [
  { role: "system", content: "You are a friendly and helpful AI assistant for kids." },
  { role: "user", content: "What sounds does a cow make?" },
]

// Chunks is an AsyncGenerator object
const chunks = await engine.chat.completions.create({
  messages,
  temperature: 1, // Example parameter
  stream: true, // <-- Enable streaming
  stream_options: { include_usage: true }, // If your engine supports this
});

let reply = "";
for await (const chunk of chunks) {
  const content = chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || "";
  reply += content;
  console.log("Streaming update:", content); // Update your UI with this chunk
  if (chunk.usage) {
    console.log("Usage Info (End of Stream):", chunk.usage); // usage typically in the last chunk
  }
}

const fullReply = await engine.getMessage(); // If your engine has a method to get the full message
console.log("Full Response:", fullReply);

Advanced Usage

Explore more advanced features and configurations:

Using Workers

Offload computation to improve UI responsiveness:

Dedicated Web Worker
// worker.ts
import { YourWorkerEngineHandler } from "@your-scope/your-package-name"; // Use your actual handler name

// Handler in the worker thread
const handler = new YourWorkerEngineHandler();
self.onmessage = (msg: MessageEvent) => {
  handler.onmessage(msg);
};

TypeScript
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
// main.ts
import { CreateYourWorkerEngine } from "@your-scope/your-package-name"; // Use your actual factory function name

async function main() {
  // Use a Worker Engine instead of the main engine directly
  const engine = await CreateYourWorkerEngine(
    new Worker(
      new URL("./worker.ts", import.meta.url),
      {
        type: "module",
      }
    ),
    selectedModel, // Your kid-friendly model identifier
    { initProgressCallback }, // engineConfig
  );

  // Use the engine for chat completion just like before
  // ...
}
main(); // Call your main function

Use Service Worker

Maintain model state across page visits and enable offline experiences:

// sw.ts
import { YourServiceWorkerEngineHandler } from "@your-scope/your-package-name"; // Use your actual handler name

let handler: YourServiceWorkerEngineHandler;

self.addEventListener("activate", function (event) {
  handler = new YourServiceWorkerEngineHandler();
  console.log("Your Service Worker is ready");
});

TypeScript
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
// main.ts
import { YourEngineInterface, CreateYourServiceWorkerEngine } from "@your-scope/your-package-name"; // Use your actual interface and factory function names

if ("serviceWorker" in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register(
    new URL("sw.ts", import.meta.url),  // worker script
    { type: "module" },
  ).then(registration => {
    console.log('Service Worker registration successful with scope: ', registration.scope);
  }, error => {
    console.log('Service Worker registration failed: ', error);
  });
}

const engine: YourEngineInterface =
  await CreateYourServiceWorkerEngine(
    selectedModel, // Your kid-friendly model identifier
    { initProgressCallback }, // engineConfig

[Other Advanced Features]

[Add sections for any other advanced features your project supports, adapting the content from the original README as needed, but focusing on your project's specifics and language.]

Full OpenAI Compatibility

Your Project Name is designed to offer compatibility with the OpenAI Chat API, allowing you to use familiar methods for text generation. Supported functionalities include:

Streaming responses

JSON-mode output

[List any other supported features like seeding, function-calling (if applicable)]

Custom Models

While Your Project Name comes with a pre-tuned kid-friendly LLaMA model, it also supports integrating custom models. You can compile and use your own model weights and libraries. Refer to our [documentation](#[link to your custom model docs]) for detailed instructions.

The core idea involves defining the location of your model artifacts (model) and the WebAssembly library (model_lib):

import { CreateYourEngine } from "@your-scope/your-package-name";

async function loadCustomModel() { // Changed function name to be distinct
  const appConfig = {
    "model_list": [
      {
        "model": "/url/to/my/custom-kid-model",
        "model_id": "MyCustomKidModel-v1-q4f32_0", // Use your own identifier
        "model_lib": "/url/to/mycustomkidmodel.wasm", // Path to your compiled wasm
      }
    ],
  };
  // Example chat option override
  const chatOpts = {
    "repetition_penalty": 1.01
  };

  // Load your custom model using the specified configuration
  const engine = await CreateYourEngine(
    "MyCustomKidModel-v1-q4f32_0", // Reference the model_id from appConfig
    { appConfig }, // Pass the custom appConfig
    chatOpts, // Optional chat options
  );

  console.log("Custom model loaded.");
}
loadCustomModel(); // Call the function

Building Core Runtime from Source (If Applicable)

[Include this section ONLY if your project builds its own core runtime from source, similar to TVMjs for WebLLM. Adapt the instructions to your specific dependencies and build process. Replace MLC-specific details.]

If your project depends on a custom build of an underlying runtime:

Install [dependency 1, e.g., Emscripten]. [Link to installation instructions]. Ensure [required tools, e.g., emcc] are in your PATH.

[Instructions for setting up runtime source, e.g., cloning a specific repo and branch/commit].

[Instructions for configuring your project's package.json to use the local runtime build].

[Instructions for building the runtime dependency].

[Any other necessary setup steps].
