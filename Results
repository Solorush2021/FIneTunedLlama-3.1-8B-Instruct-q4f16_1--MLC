Once upon a sunny morning, Twinkle the bunny found a shiny star in the meadow! “Oh, sparkly!” she giggled, hopping with joy. The star whispered, “I’m lost! Can you help me get home?” Twinkle nodded and called her friends—Bouncy the squirrel and Sunny the bird. They danced through the forest, following a rainbow path. The star twinkled brighter with every step. At the tallest hill, they jumped high, and whoosh—the star flew back to the sky! “Thank you!” it sang, glowing happily. The friends cheered, “We’re star heroes!”
